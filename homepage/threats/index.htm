<hr>
<p>
Here comes a explanation of threat-format. The format could be more compact, but
I want it simple so it is easier to write a program that can search
a board for these threats. All threats in the list are white threats. Any
line that starts with a <b>#</b> is a comment line in the threat list.
</p>
<p>
One threat could be written as:
<code>
</code></p><pre><code>W-W+B-BW1-BW1
3
-1,1 +2
C3\
  </code></pre><code>
</code>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>W-W+B-BW1-BW1</b> is a description how the threat looks 
on the edge of the board. Start by going down and draw to the right like this:
<p>
<img src="./Trax threat database_files/threat.gif" width="212" height="209">
</p>
<b>W</b> means a white end and <b>B</b> a black end of a line.
<b>-</b> is a left turn and <b>+</b> is a right turn.
The <b>1</b> after two of the <b>W's</b> means that these two 
white line-ends must be connected in some way.
</li>
<li>
<b>3</b> tells that the threat is a 3 stage
threat.
</li>
<li>
<b>-1,1 +2</b> says this threat will expand 1 row to the left, 1 row to the right and
2 row down. This is important that know if there
is a line-threat from the other player or if it is a 8x8Trax.
</li>
<li>
<b>C3\</b> is the move that activates the threat.
</li></ol>
